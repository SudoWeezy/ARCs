## Abstract
This ARC aims to change the wallets' interface to protect users from reading unintended messages and avoids having clickable URLs inside a transaction's note. 

## Motivation
Algorand's transaction allows sending messages through notes. Unfortunately, as Algorand'transactions do not cost much, this also means that malicious (or just advertising) accounts can send spam to users.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC 822</a>..

### Treshold
To protect users, Wallets **MUST** implement features enabled by default that respect the following conventions:
- A threshold that **MAY** be configurable. If not, it **MUST** be equal to 1 Algo. Transactions that do not respect the threshold:
  - **SHOULD** not trigger a push notification
  - **SHOULD** have a warning when the user tries to see the note
-  Every message containing a URL:
  - **SHOULD** not have a clickable link (ipfs, https, http ..)
  - **SHOULD** display a warning when the user tries to see the note

## Rationale
Notes are helpful; we can not simply ask wallets to ignore them.
Another idea was to display only messages for assets transactions (The opt-in feature prevents unintended messages)

## Backwards Compatibility
None

## Security Considerations
Even if this standard aims to protect users, these rules **MAY** not filter every kind of spam.
